Welcome to UniSchedule Backend! This monorepo contains all the source code necessary to run each of the micro-services of the application. You can go to the directory of each micro-service to read all the required documentation to get it installed and running. Currently, we have implemented the following micro-services:

- **[AvailableSpaces](/AvailableSpaces):** Find available classrooms on campus for your meetings!

- **[Databases](/Databases):** Utility scripts to set-up the databases used in this project!

- **[GroupsFriendsEvents](/GroupsFriendsEvents):** Handle your profile, groups, friends and events!

- **[Planner](/Planner):** Calculate availability of time slots to schedule your meetings!
